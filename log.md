# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed step and pause button, added area to GUI for robot configuration parameters

**Thoughts:** Back working on my Pass the Butter robot software. It's good to get back into this project after a long break, hopefully I can keep momentum this time.
