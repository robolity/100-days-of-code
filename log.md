# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added text input boxes for the robot's physical parameters to the robot configuration parameters section of the GUI. If these parameters are changed in the GUI, the robot is loaded with the new values when the simulation is reset. 

**Thoughts:** I'd like to add all the other parameters for the simulator that I currently have as constants in the simulator code to input boxes on the GUI. Then I'd like to save these values and load them from a file. This will be handy for quickly adapting the simulator for different robots.

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed step and pause button, added area to GUI for robot configuration parameters

**Thoughts:** Back working on my Pass the Butter robot software. It's good to get back into this project after a long break, hopefully I can keep momentum this time.
