# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added the robot's physical dimensions to the robot config parameters and save/load function. Modified the parameter add function so that it's more generic for adding and accessing the parameters.

**Thoughts:** Learnt about the power of setattr and getattr for creating objects dynamically, which is really really useful.

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added save and load buttons so that the robot parameters listed in the GUI can be saved and loaded to quickly change the robot in the simulator. I also updated the UML file for the project to correctly reflect the current class structure of the code.

**Thoughts:** Making good progress on the project, the save and load buttons were surprisingly easy to setup by copying the code for the map save and load. I updated the UML so that I can have a clearer picture of what class should connect to what, so I don't create a birds nest by accident. Next step is to add all the robot parameters to the GUI, as I'd like to get the GUI finished before proceeding onto integrating the robot's sensors properly.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added text input boxes for the robot's physical parameters to the robot configuration parameters section of the GUI. If these parameters are changed in the GUI, the robot is loaded with the new values when the simulation is reset. 

**Thoughts:** I'd like to add all the other parameters for the simulator that I currently have as constants in the simulator code to input boxes on the GUI. Then I'd like to save these values and load them from a file. This will be handy for quickly adapting the simulator for different robots.

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed step and pause button, added area to GUI for robot configuration parameters

**Thoughts:** Back working on my Pass the Butter robot software. It's good to get back into this project after a long break, hopefully I can keep momentum this time.
